Description:
    This generator creates erb views for use with the simple_form gem
    by Plataforma Tec. It also uses the show_for gem for displaying
    model attributes in the show.html.erb that it generates.
    
    Before you can use this generator you need to install both gems:
    
    gem install simple_form
    gem install show_for

Example:
    rails generate simple_form_erb:scaffold Thing
    
    This will create:
        app/views/things/index.html.erb
        app/views/things/edit.html.erb
        app/views/things/show.html.erb
        app/views/things/new.html.erb
        app/views/things/_form.html.erb
        app/views/shared/_form_errors.html.erb
